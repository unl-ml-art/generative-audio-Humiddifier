## Abstract

On January 14th 2022, BROCKHAMPTON announced their indefinite hiatus on social media, leaving many fans disappointed and hopeless for new content. The boy-band is known for their hip-hop, redefining, diy style and have a dedicated following across many demographics. Throughout the group's career there have been sexual assault allegations in regards to members of the group, leaving fans in a hard place on deciding whether to support the group or not. 

In a light of both of these events, we want to create a new BROCKHAMPTON track, separated from the artists, with the use of AIJukebox. BROCKHAMPTON's music has a place in both of our pasts. Their music is nostalgic, unique and capulsates a feeling for both of us. With the project we are hoping to revive some of the groups likeness in a new track. We are looking to find new elements that remind us of BROCKHAMPTON, such as, unique hip-hop beats, spoken introductions, and catchy melodies.
