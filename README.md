## Abstract

On January 14th 2022, BROCKHAMPTON announced their indefinite hiatus on social media, leaving many fans disappointed and hopeless for new content. The boy-band is known for their hip-hop, redefining, diy style and have a dedicated following across many demographics. Throughout the group's career there have been sexual assault allegations in regards to members of the group, leaving fans in a hard place on deciding whether to support the group or not. 

In a light of both of these events, we want to create a new BROCKHAMPTON track, separated from the artists, with the use of AIJukebox. BROCKHAMPTON's music has a place in both of our pasts. Their music is nostalgic, unique and capulsates a feeling for both of us. With the project we are hoping to revive some of the groups likeness in a new track. We are looking to find new elements that remind us of BROCKHAMPTON, such as, unique hip-hop beats, spoken introductions, and catchy melodies. 

## Model/Data

We used 25 of our favorite BROCKHAMPTON song lyrics to generate our own. We also used the songs BLEACH and BERLIN as files to upload to the code for the primed song generation.

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

This was a collab notebook I stumbled upon while searching tutorials and fixes for Open On Demand. It is a much newer version of the code we used in 

## Code

Added to files named "One_Click_Jukebox_with_Autosave_v2.." It is a ipynb file we used on google collab.

## Technical Notes

We had a lot of trouble with running out of memory? Cuda memory. We'd like to revist this project with more ability to generate more clips. The code didn't work after the first pass. We had to set up my google drive to the code on google collab. That was really finicky. And everytime I ran the code I had to create a new notebook with a new name or else the code would get very confused.
