# Project 2 Generative Audio

## Abstract

For this project I was inspired by the robotic vocals found in early computer speech, specifically in musical endeavors like the first singing computer, IBM 7094. In my spare time I often listen to utauloid compositions, a sub genre of fan made music made with community made singing synth pop stars. I have always been entranced with the idea of singing computers as it is a very human art, requiring the human vocal. I am also curious in the possibility of applying machine learning and deep learning models to enhance the sound of these Vocaloids. Bring emotion and likeness to the sometimes-stiff nature of singing computers. 

For the result of this project, I want to make my own Virtual Pop Star using Utauloid, my personal voice recordings, and Enunu, a AI plugin, trained to help your Utauloid sound more natural. Both of my parents are very musically inclined, but I did not get so lucky with my own voice, as I am tone deaf. Since I am not vocally inclined, I want to specifically experiment my own voice to see what my emotional response is to hear myself sing well. I hope to cover one song using a community made UST.
