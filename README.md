# Project 2 Generative Audio

## Abstract

For this project I was inspired by the robotic vocals found in early computer speech, specifically in musical endevors like the first singing computer, IBM 7094. In my spare time I often listen to utauloid compositions, a sub genres of fan made music made with commmunity made singing synth pop stars.I have always been entanced with the idea of singing computers as it is a very human art, requiring the human vocal. I am also curious in the positibility of applying machine learning and deep learning models to enhance the sound of these Vocaloids. Bring emotion and likeness to the sometimes stiff nature of singing computers. 

For the result of this project I want to make my own Virtual Pop Star using Utauloid, my personal voice recordings, and Enunu, a AI plugin, trained to help your Utauloid sound more natural. Both of my parents are very muscially inclinded, but I did not get so lucky with my own voice, as I am tone deaf. Since I am not vocally inclined, I want to specifically experiment my own voice to see what my emotional response is to hearing myself sing well. I hope to cover one song using a community made UST.
